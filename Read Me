Hi,
Feel free to use in whatever way you'd like, if you'd like to referance me, the name is Liz Triller. 
These are not official DUNE colors just my eyeballing it. If you have any sugestions or if you make a cool illistration I am on the DUNE Slack! 
Be warned, I find krita pretty user friendly but I may not have set up the illistrations in a way to be easily eddited. Hopefully pngs are more usefull.
